# FS Account Scorer

Ranks 20 North American banks and insurers by CX opportunity. Combines App Store ratings with SEC filing analysis to identify companies most likely to need digital consulting.

**How it works:**
- Red (65+) = poor app ratings + high CX pain = best prospects
- Click through for SEC-extracted signals (AI investment, digital transformation mentions)
- Evidence sourced from 10-K/10-Q filings and App Store reviews

**Data sources:**
- Apple App Store ratings and reviews
- SEC EDGAR filings (MD&A, Risk Factors, technology mentions)

**MVP limitations:**
- US companies only have SEC data (Canadian companies have App Store only)
- Manual data refresh
- No executive contacts yet
